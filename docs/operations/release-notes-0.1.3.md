# CapyCTL 0.1.3

Unreleased.

## Memory

- **Short `resources`.** A model that restarts instead of parking can state
  its memory as `resources: {gpu: 11GiB, ram: 2GiB}` instead of five phases:
  CapyCTL reserves both figures while it starts, runs and stops and nothing
  once it is stopped. On a unified-memory machine the pool is charged their
  sum. The five phases are still accepted, and `capyctl validate config` shows
  what the short form stands for. See the TensorFold section of the
  [engines guide](../guide/engines.md).
- **SGLang on a discrete GPU accepts the context `status` shows.** SGLang took
  its memory fraction of the GPU memory free when it started, not of the
  card's total, so on a 16 GB laptop GPU it held about two thirds of the KV
  cache CapyCTL passed and refused inputs over 42,772 tokens where `status`
  showed 63,920. The fraction now covers that difference; SGLang still
  allocates only the KV cache and state CapyCTL sized.
- **SGLang hybrid models get their concurrency.** When you state no memory
  request, CapyCTL now adds a hybrid model's per-request state to the request it
  derives, for `max_concurrent_requests` (or 8) as far as the machine holds it,
  instead of borrowing it from the margin or the KV cache. Qwen3.8-27B at the
  default KV cache runs 8 requests where it ran 5, and asks for about 6 GiB
  more (16 GiB with DFlash2). A revision measured before this release keeps its
  sizing; a new revision of it gets the state.
- **SGLang hybrid models run 8 requests by default.** Without
  `max_concurrent_requests`, a hybrid model on SGLang runs up to 8 requests at
  once, as TensorFold does, instead of up to 32; dense models are unchanged.
  The router still accepts 32 per deployment and the rest wait in SGLang's
  queue. Set `max_concurrent_requests` to run more, and CapyCTL sizes the state
  for that count.
- **SGLang with speculative decoding parks again.** A deployment with
  `--speculative-algorithm` in its arguments parks `deep` by default instead of
  restarting: the park gives back the KV cache and keeps the weights, the
  draft model's included, so a wake reloads nothing. It frees less than a
  model without a draft model (the weights stay in memory), and the parked
  charge is measured on the first park. `residency: host_backed` is still
  refused for it; a deployment that states `restart_only` keeps restarting.
  On a 128 GB GB10, Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 with DFlash2 parks in about a second,
  holds 33.4 GiB parked and answers about 2 s after a request wakes it. That
  is above a standalone's parked limit (a quarter of the memory), so once
  that is measured on its first park, later parks are refused and it stays
  loaded.

## Standalone

- **Standalone no longer parks an SGLang ModelOpt model it cannot wake.** A
  `deep` or `host_backed` SGLang deployment with ModelOpt (NVFP4)
  quantization started in standalone, parked, and then failed to wake, since
  SGLang cannot reload those weights; the instance stayed `uncertain` until a
  stop. Standalone now refuses its start with `capability_missing:deep_park`,
  as a host agent already did, so nothing is parked. Deploy such a model
  `restart_only`. A model with speculative decoding, whose park keeps its
  weights, still parks.
